TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript. TypeScript catches way more errors than JavaScript does, and even explains them in greater detail. With this alone, it seems like the better option. JavaScript is easier to learn, but the switch of types can be difficult to learn about. But once you experience it enough, it is a fierce language to be used.
